        <!-- Tutorial segment start -->
        <section>Violence was never a rarity in the Eastern Slums, but matters have only further deteriorated from the threat of the Dragon's wrath in this past month.  You remember that night with defining clarity.  <br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>

        <section>Night was overtaken by the fury from the monsters beneath the land. Great cracks manifested their way from the ground with unknown creatures seeping out of them. Disturbed from their long slumber, the inherent violence of the tangible beings ran rampant throughout the streets of the town. <br><br><button>--&gt;</button> </section>
       
        <section> You are in the dusty unpaved town square. Before you is a dimly lit alley.<br><br><button>Go to the alley.</button></section>
       
        <section>Large wax candles hang from rusted metal poles that do a terrible job at illuminating the pathway. In the distance of the dark, flickering orange expanse emerges a gruffled shape.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
        
        <!-- Initiate encounter -->
        <section>You encounter a scrawny, violent loinclothed caper. (Goblin)<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
        
        <!-- Post-battle -->
        <section>Footsteps appear right behind you as there were no one there previously. "That was a fine victory young lass, now just who are you?"<br><br><button>Turn around.</button></section>
        <section>It is the famous Grand Wizard Kobain, the legendary sorcerer and last defender of the Eastern Slums!<br><br><button>Share praise enthusiastically</button></section>
        <section> You enthusiatically share your praises, maybe too much. The keen interest Kobain has in your abilities lead him to enlist you as his apprentice, you are eager to learn from him<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
    
<section> Since that night, life was never the same again. You absolutely hated it.<br><br><button>:/</button></section>
<section> Learning new magic skills has been completely nonexistent and the mediocrity of the tower's tight walls have only generated complete and utter boredom.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> You have completed notes on the latest scroll shipment from South Polend and took no happiness in scribing out each situation. Even amateurs could transcribe these “magical” occurrences and crimes throughout the kingdom.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>   
<section> You notice a pattern in the recent scrolls, all in relation to ancient relics described by old fairy tales. Polend has been dramatically more fanatic since dragons have been proven to be real and creatures of bygone eras rising from extinction. <br><br><button></button></section>
<section> Regardless of your trust in Kobain's decision in putting you here, you could no longer sit here and scrawl footnotes on meaningless reports. You are in your living quarters.<br><br><button>[Inspect desk.]</button> <button>[Go Downstairs.]</button> <button>[Inspect the bookshelf.]</button></section>    

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
        <!-- inspectDesk-->
<section>  Your desk is a sleek, wooden table, unorganized with messy parchments and a feather quill carelessly placed off to the side. A dribble of ink slowly moves its way to the edge of the desk. In other words, nothing important. <br><br><button>[Go Downstairs.]</button> <button>[Inspect the bookshelf.]</button></section> 

    <!-- inspectTheBookshelf--> 
<section>A shelf containing many books of the histories, legends, and culture of  the world. You pertain no interest in any of these topics.<br><br><button>[Go downstairs.]</button></section>

    <!-- goDownstairs-->
    <section> You descend down the aged wooden steps cylindrically built to wrap around the area of the tower. As you walk, a faintly growing scent of pipe-smoke and the crackle of an active fireplace becomes clearer as you enter the main quarters.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section>Grand Wizard Kobain sits leisurely in his study with an indistinctly amorphous orb generating a cascade of colors, humanoid shapes can be seen within it's shapeless center. Hugging the corner of the wall between the stairway and the main quarters sits a lone display table, pristinely detailed as it is delicate. The table is used by an expensive vial collection of moaning toad souls, each one dreadfully muted by the confines of their vial.
    <br><br><button>[Make your presence known.]</button> <button>[Ask Kobain to finally teach a new spell.]</button></section>    

    <!-- makePresenceKnown -->
<section> As you exit the stairway, you trip and stumble into the foot of the pristine table. The legs bend and snap as they collapse, generating a castrophany of an auditorily vivid smash of split wood, broken glass, staining ectoplasm, and moaning toad souls rampantly flying around. Kobain takes notice without looking back.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section>“Good morning Hannah, I see you have a keen interest in learning new and fantastic ways to destroy the furniture here.”<br><br><button>[Ask Kobain to finally teach a spell.]</button></section>

    <!-- askTeachASpell -->
<section> As you exit the hallway, you approach Kobain with a proposition to end your boredom. The orb's shape fades as you close in to get a better look at the shapes.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> “Hm, it seems this orb is particularly shy to reveal its contents. Ah, hello Hannah. Have you finished today's scroll shipment?” The curiously inquisitive wizard turns his attention towards you. <br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> Full of enthusiasm, you tell Kobain about a distinct oddity from the scroll shipments of the past week. Constant robberies and crimes linking to a connected ulterior motive. Many have heard the legend of the Dragon's relics, so there is no need to repeat such redundant stories.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section>The legend has motivated citizens and monsters alike to search for these safeguarded relics. You tell Kobain that if you could retrieve these relics before any other adventurers then the King would favor Kobain's endeavors of helping the Eastern Slums become safer and more habitable.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section>“Thank you for bringing this to my attention. But Hannah, you are no near strong enough to take on a quest like this. It is a treacherous journey and it isn't worth the risk of losing a generation of magical knowledge. As you may know, it is a complete rarity for anyone to be capable of using magic let alone dedicating time to the upkeep of our knowledge”<br><br><button>[I totally didn't know any of that.]</button></section>
<section>“You are a dying breed, we simply cannot risk the importance of your life for rumors.”<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> You return to your living quarters hours later with a book binding under your arm. Which chapter do you read?<br><br><button>[The Birth of Flame]</button> <button>[The Source of Moisture]</button>[The Genesis of Terra]<button></button> </section>
<!-- Adds level to on element like the orb would, think Fallout 4 SPECIAL book -->

<section>A new scroll is delivered to your window by a dove-hawk, this message directly from the king. The scroll reads:<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section>Hannah N. Chicago, I send you this letter in desperation and severity. You are the only known capable magic-user in the Country and I require your services. If you could, please meet my messenger in front of the Eastern Dungeon Memorial the moment you receive this message.
    Best regards, 
    King Geedorah <br><br><button>[Tell Kobain about the letter.]</button></section>
<section>Scroll in hand, you run downstairs to tell Kobain the news, but he is nowhere to be found. The front door of the tower is ajar, wind blowing the hinges back and forth. A non distinct trail of beard dander trails into the distance. <br><br><button>[Follow the trail of wizard dander.]</button></section>
<section>You take the path that the dust-trail left behind. Beyond a tiled path leads to the exit gate surrounding the tower's perimeter. A short stairwell going up, the steps in the shape of smooth, hollowed stone from the center of large boulders. <br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section>Reaching the summit of the short stairwell, you see the dust-trail go straight before abruptly shifting its path into a nearby alley.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section>This alley is subtly different from the rest of the city, the changes lie in the fact that the cheaply cobbled gravel road smoothes out into some other form of stones, these stones lead into two separate hallways. <br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>

<!-- ThisDoorKillsYou :( -->
<section>On the right, the hall is seemingly mundane apart from its natural stillness. The right hall seems to be naturally tranquil, even beckoning you to step through its' entryway<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section>The dust-trail leads into the path on the left, strangulated in its design, the architecture of this hall is oddly disturbing. The further you look down, the darker and more abyss-like it becomes. Akin to an illusion, it feels impossible for a simple hallway to look so morbidly bizarre. You feel compelled to abandon the following of the trail. Something tells you not to listen.<br><br><button>[Trust your instinct.]</button> <button>[Listen, stray from the dust trail.]</button></section>

    <!-- ListenStrayDustTrail -ScriptedDeathScene -->
<section> You venture into the mundane hallway, feeding your comfort and straying from the dust-trail. All is fine, you are fine. That is what you tell yourself.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section>The surroundings dim from the cozy lighting it once represented. You feel the greatest constriction against your body in the darkness.<br><br><button>[You lost! Good day sir!]</button></section>
                                                                                                                                                        <!-- Replicates previous prompt -->
    <!-- trustInstinct -->
<section> You follow the effortlessly placed dust trail, walking through the stress inducing hall to the left. The entryway whispers an unintelligible sound as you make your first steps beyond it. <br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> Light leaves your surroundings gradually, with each echoing step as you cross it. Light. Dim. Dark. Black. <br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> You try to hug the walls of the walkway, nothing is within your grasp, as if there were no walls in the first place.<br><br><button>[Blink in the darkness.]</button> <button>[Cry because you are screwed.]</button></section>
    <!-- Both lead to this response -->
<section> You blink in the blinding void. As soon as you do, the illusion ends and you are on the other side of the hallway, now looking as mundane as the other. The dander trail picks up and leads to the Eastern Dungeon Memorial. <br><br><button>[Follow trail inside.]</button></section>
<section> You try to open the entrance door for the Eastern Dungeon Memorial, to no avail. The door is locked. <br><br><button>[Find a way inside.]</button></section>
<section> You pace along the memorial's perimeter, finding an opening to the roof shaping into a ramp-esque ledge.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> A ladder leans on another building adjacent to the Memorial. In order to grab it, you have to push it off from the other building's roof. An unlocked gate is between you and the other building. <br><br><button>[Open the gate, enter the building.]</button></section>
<section> You enter the building, it appears to be an abandoned smithy. Graffiti is painted along the walls of the forgotten forge, old rusted metal and unfinished armors lay sprawled around the chambers. <br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> The furnace, now unused and neglected, proven by the visible layer of dust blanketing it. On a nearby countertop, the shape of a large hammer imprints itself against the dust layer. 
    <br><br><button>[Locate the rooftop stairway.]</button></section>
<section> You explore the structure of the forge, looking for a pathway to reach the rooftop. You hear a crackle in the far left corner of the forge, a thimble of burning light flickers in the distance. <br><br><button>[You encounter a stranger.]</button></section>
                    <!-- InitiatesEncounter-->

<section> Behind the smithing enthusiast is a stairway leading to the rooftop.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> You exit the forge and spot the ladder, pushing it off the wall and dropping it against the opening in the memorial's roof opening. <br><br><button>[Enter the Eastern Dungeon Memorial.]</button></section>
<section> You go inside the Memorial building from the rooftop door, you appear to be inside the attic. <br><br><button>[Leave the attic.]</button></section>

    <!-- Chapter 2:  -->
<section> The interior of the Memorial building is anciently beautiful. You begin on the second floor, looking down from the protective railing. The hall along the way showcases various arrangements of armor suits through the eras of Polend's history.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> The display begins with a highly advanced armor designed for mobility dubbed the ‘Blitzkreig' proudly poses at the end of the arrangement, with the opposite end showing a modestly proportioned plate armor, primitive in nature yet still striking awe and dominance. It was dubbed, “The Cypress”<br><br><button>[Go down the stairs.]</button></section>
<section> Descending the elegant stairway leads into the atrium, the expansive room is filled by the light coming down from the glass ceiling. You hear a murmur of speech in one of the nearby rooms. <br><br><button>--&gt;</button> <button>[Look around.]</button></section>

    <!-- LookAround -->
<section> You see a large linen material covering a doorway, you feel that it's best to give it it's privacy.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> You enter what looks like an exhibit room, dedicated to a myth about an ancient ice-deity of some kind. You don't really care about that, ice is a particularly stupid thing to think about. Hannah finds Grand Wizard Kobain speaking to a friendly stranger. <br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> “Ah, Hannah, good to finally see you. I was hoping you would show up here eventually!”<br><br><button>[Grand Wizard! Where have you been?]</button></section>
<section> “There has been a, complication since we last spoke. I had to leave very urgently due to.. Well, you're here now, and I require your assistance!”<br><br><button>[Who's the mummy?]</button> <button>[ok :&rpar;]</button></section>
    <!-- MummyDesc -->
<section> You size up the oddly cloth-covered man. All facial details are omitted by the wrap around his head, he wears a traveler's apparel save for the oddly patterned fabric hanging from around his neck and worn messenger's bag around his right shoulder. <br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> “This is the messenger of course, he comes directly from King Geedorah!” The messenger stares blankly at a fireplace on the opposite wall of the room. “Hm.”<br><br><button>[I can help you now.]</button></section>
<section> “Fantastic! Over here, over here.”<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>

    <!-- okResponseLeadsHere -->
<section> Grand Wizard Cobain leads you to a humble corridor near the exhibit room. The messenger follows behind. <br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> Cobain stops at a thin creased line between the smooth marble wall, then makes an unintelligible chant.<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> The creased line slides open with a rough skidding sound, revealing a torch lit stairway. <br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> “This is the real memorial, Hannah. Within it, lies an ancient relic unbeknownst to most inhabitants of Polend. There are things that wish to obtain it before we, which is why we must retrieve it first. Do you understand?”<br><br><button>[Of course.]</button> <button>[Er, no.]</button></section>

    <!-- [1] -->
<section> “Fantastic! The messenger will guide you to the first chamber, he knows it better than I”<br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
    <!-- [2] leadsTo1 -->
<section> “Huh? What?”<br><br><button>[Of course.]</button></section>

<section> You descend the stairway with the messenger, Cobain stays up at the entrance. <br><br><button>--&gt;</button></section>
<section> The walk is long and silent, the messenger has the resemblance of a lone wanderer, content with the serenity of silence. You find the silence deafening.<br><br><button>[Why were you here with Kobain?]</button></section>
<section> “Hm… Kobain. He is up there.”<br><br><button>[He <em>is</em> up there.]</button></section>
<section> You arrive at the entrance for the original Eastern Dungeon. “There are things here you are not expecting, Hannah. Things you are subconsciously aware of.”
    <br><br><button>[Enter the dungeon]</button> <button>[What does that mean?]</button></section>

    <!-- [1] -->
